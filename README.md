# Titanic-Prediction-Model

This repository contains my submission to the kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". In this notebook, I used exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, data transformation, and preprocessing to create a simple Naive Bayes model implementation to predict which passengers out of a test case would survive the Titanic shipwreck.
